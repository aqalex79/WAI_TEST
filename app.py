                1. Display a table of nutritional values (calories, protein, fat, carbohydrates).
                2. Focus on these 4 key areas:
                
                Blood Sugar Balance: How well does the meal help maintain stable blood sugar levels? Are the carbs healthy (whole grains, veggies), and does it avoid sugars or refined carbs?
                
                Protein & Healthy Fats: Does the meal include enough quality protein and healthy fats (like those from fish, nuts, or avocado) to support hormone balance and keep hunger in check?
                
                Fiber & Nutrients: Does the meal include fiber (from veggies, whole grains) and important nutrients (vitamin D, magnesium, omega-3s) that support PCOS?
                
                Inflammation & Portion Control: Does the meal contain anti-inflammatory ingredients (like omega-3s, turmeric) and are the portion sizes suitable for managing weight?
                
                Please provide simple, actionable feedback in these 4 categories, and suggest any easy improvements for a PCOS-friendly diet.
